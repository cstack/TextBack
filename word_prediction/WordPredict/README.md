Current usage:
java WordPredict dictionary max_choices

Where dictionary is the dictionary file (i.e. word-freq.dict) and max_choices is the maximum number of choices that should be returned

To-do:
* Dictionary file contains duplicate words (because some words have multiple parts of speech with different frequencies); these duplicates should perhaps be added together
